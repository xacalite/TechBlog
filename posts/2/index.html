We think you should be too, because nothing says ‚ÄúI care about my work‚Äù more than writing an extended essay on it. We‚Äôre proud of our docs, and we want the world to know it!</p><p>To keep things consistent, but also unmistakably different, we use two high quality documentation platforms for internal and external materials.</p><p>Internally, we use Slite. Slite has some awesome features that help it live up to its tagline: ‚ÄúThe workplace for remote teams.‚Äù The expected features are all there - the ability for users to seamlessly collaborate on docs in real-time, and to share docs publicly, with the whole team, or just select individuals. You can set up templates for reusability and standardization, and import content from basic text, Markdown, HTML, Microsoft Word, Google Drive, Confluence, Notion, Evernote, and Quip. You can sort docs into a logical hierarchy (you want to do that, right?), easily embed videos and other media while applying formatting to make everything look sleek and sexy, and you can retrieve docs from the trash that you accidentally deleted. You can monitor revision history, revert to backups, create and resolve comments, and export docs¬† to PDF oir Markdown; as you‚Äôd expect from a mature well-thought out documentation platform.</p><p>All of these features pale in comparison to the best one however, which is that you can assign a unique cute emoji to the table of contents view of each article üòç So cute!</p><p><img src=emojis.png alt="Slite fruit emojis on article titles."></p><p>For our customer-facing documentation, we use HelpDocs. HelpDocs has some amazing features that make it a great choice for our company as we blast through the growth stage of our product‚Äôs life cycle üöÄ</p><p>HelpDocs provides a variety of attractive themes for presenting docs in different ways depending on your desired use case, while more in-depth customization options are provided for those with the knowledge to create their own HTML templates and apply custom CSS and Javascript. Articles can be arranged and formatted any way you like, while access privileges can be controlled through different levels of authorization, to make sure your beloved engineers stay hands off external-facing materials and don‚Äôt compromise them with overly-technical jargon (looking at you, machine learning team üëÄ). While the one feature still missing from the HelpDocs platform (as of the time of writing) is the ability to create and apply truly modular content, if you can get away without it in the short-term, you‚Äôll save a ton as you scale up with HelpDocs‚Äô flat-rate monthly plans versus the more expensive per-user pricing of competitors. Plus, the HelpDocs support is first-rate and the product continues to evolve as the company publishes product updates that add new features and fixes to the platform. Smooth integration with Pendo gives our users easy access to product docs within our app, ensuring that help is never more than a few clicks (or taps) away for our users.</p><p>I appreciate being told what I need and want to hear. Keep it up HelpDocs loading screens! Flattery will get you everywhere.</p><p><img src=loading.png alt="Your docs are looking real nice today. HelpDocs, powered by unicorns. Remember to stay hydrated."></p><p>The combination of technologies helps Klue achieve a high level of excellence in both our internal and external-facing documentation.
